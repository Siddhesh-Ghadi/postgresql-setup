	postgresql-setup: do not resist on PGPORT in service file

	We use /etc/sysconfig/postgresql for PGDATA configuration.  PGPORT there
	is optional as it is possible (and it is by default) to configure it in
	postgresql.conf.

	postgresql-setup: split this script from postgresql package

	Maintenance of postgresql-setup script becoming harder and dealing with
	its development in Fedora Rawhide dist-git costs quite a lot of work.
	Turns out that it would be better to start development separately and
	possibly package it separately also in future (which would be beneficial
	because we could not respin whole PostgreSQL package for hot-fix in
	postgresql-setup).

	Possibly, this package could be useful for other distributions.

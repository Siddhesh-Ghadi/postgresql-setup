* testsuite
    - check bash "static" analysis

* root-testsuite (future)
    - check that --port is required for @ units
    - check that the --port option in '--{initdb,upgrade} --port XXX' is ignored
      (and user warned) when port is already specified somewhere else (systemd
      or postgresql.conf)

* warn about privileged port usage

* bash-completion script

* coloring?

* make the README.rpm-dist manual page as it allows user showing the content
  in formatting based on its own preference.  It allows also easier templating
  (too-long lines, etc).

* build system
    - generate the binary scripts outside '$(srcdir)' as maintainer tends to
      edit generated file instead its '*.in' parent

* Allow guys from KDE upgrade the PG stack somehow.

* stylesheets & html version for README.rpm-dist

* option for admin-defined configuration file

* old stack breakage after pg_upgrade (check whats going on?)

* check for running postmaster!  (even running postgresql92 server breaks
  upgrade from postgresql to rh-postgresql94-postgresql on RHEL6)

* SELinux advice (if selinux is not disabled)

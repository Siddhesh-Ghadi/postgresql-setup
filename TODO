* Testsuite
    - check that none of @PATTERN@ is un-expanded in generated files

* --upgrade
    - 'echo -n' breaks the error messages from 'restorecon'

* bash-completion script

* make the README.rpm-dist manual page as it allows user showing the content
  in formatting based on its own preference.  It allows also easier templating
  (too-long lines, etc).
